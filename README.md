### **1. Usage:**
This application was created as a Directory one could use to search for a specific employee to access their email or telephone number quickly.  By inputing a name in the search box, it will filter out the other names.  Also, by clicking on either the header "name", "email", or "phone" it will change which category the order is in, as seen in the screenshot.


### **2. Technologies Used:**
The React framework was used to generate this application.  Because seed information was needed to create "employees" for the directory, the API randomuser (https://randomuser.me/) was used to generate generic information.  Bootstrap was also used for styling purposes.
